# Mood Tracker App

The **Mood Tracker** app helps you track your mood over time in an easy and efficient way. It stores your data locally on your device, so you can view your mood history even when offline. The app uses a service worker to cache important resources, ensuring a smooth experience.

## Features

- **Track Mood**: Log your mood at any time, whether you're feeling happy, sad, excited, or any other emotion.
- **Offline Support**: The app stores data locally on your device, allowing you to track your mood even without an internet connection.
- **Cache Resources**: Key resources like images, the homepage, and the manifest are cached on the user's device, so they load faster and are available offline.
- **Easy Interface**: The app is designed with a simple interface that allows for quick and easy mood tracking.

## How It Works

1. **Caching**: The app uses a Service Worker to cache resources like `index.html`, `logo.png`, and other necessary files. This means the app can load quickly, even when offline.
2. **Local Storage**: All mood tracking data is stored locally on the user's device, so there is no need for an internet connection. You can access your mood history whenever you want.
3. **Fetch Event**: When you visit the app, it checks if the resources are cached on your device. If not, it fetches them from the server and stores them in the cache for future use.
4. **Data Preservation**: Data is preserved even if you close the app or lose network connectivity.

## Installation

To use the Mood Tracker app:

1. **Download the app**:
   - Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
   
2. **Set up the project**:
   - Open the `index.html` file in a browser to start using the app. Thereâ€™s no need for any installation process, as the app is entirely client-side.

## Technology Stack

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** for front-end development.
- **Service Workers** for offline support and caching resources.
- **Local Storage** for storing mood data on the user's device.

## Future Improvements

- **Mood Graphs**: Add visual representations of your mood over time.
- **Export Data**: Allow users to export their mood logs as CSV files for further analysis.
- **Customizable Moods**: Let users define their own moods and labels.
- **Sync with Cloud**: Optionally, sync mood data to a cloud server for backup or multi-device access.
